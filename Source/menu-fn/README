HALF-LIFE WON MENU - QUAKEC VERSION
===================================

This menu logic is part of the FreeCS project.
It's a close recreation of the Half-Life main-menu (pre-Steam), also known as
the Half-Life WON menu (or just WON Menu - you get the idea).
It was used between 1998 and 2004.

It attempts to parse string-data and bitmaps from the original paths
whenever it can. 

The original data is required for it to work.

It's created from scratch and is not C++ - it's QuakeC and meant to be used
within FTE QuakeWorld. The file extensions are only changed in order to help
with the syntax highlighting choice of your favorite editor.

This codebase is to be compiled with FTEQCC, no other compiler is supported.
No engine other than FTE QuakeWorld is supported. I won't support anything else.

The code has a LICENSE attached to it, I'd encourage you to read it.
If you don't want to comply with the LICENSE, you either don't use the software
or we could still negotiate a separate license agreement (for $$$).

A few warnings to the uneducated:
If you're planning on merging or using any of this code in combination with the
original Half-Life SDK, you're violating the Half-Life SDK License Agreement.
This includes using it in combination with the original Half-Life binaries and
libraries. Valve has spoken out against such projects for the reason above.
They might not take action against you, but I certainly ~might~.
I hope this all does not discourage you from using it in your own project.
As long as you comply with the license, you'll be fine!

Why does this sound so harsh?
Over the past decade enough Half-Life projects have sprung up that have violated 
and _abused_ the GPL, thus discouraging entities from releasing their sources in
fear of such behaviour. This has done more harm than any good.

If anyone was to intentionally distribute content created with the Half-Life SDK
with this component, it'd violate the Half-Life SDK AND the GPL.

I recommend that you use this menu without relying on Half-Life file formats.
FreeCS gets around this by not actually shipping the CS content as part of the
project. User superior formats such as IQM (instead of MDL) and Q3 BSP!

Thanks to Spike for FTEQCC's advanced features and his engine, FTEQW, that makes
FreeCS and other projects even possible.
