HALF-LIFE ENTITY BASE - QUAKEC VERSION
======================================

This server-side logic is part of the FreeCS project.
It's a reverse-engineering effort to get Half-Life entities closely
compatible with FTE QuakeWorld.

They are made possible through the documentation efforts of twhl.info

It's created from scratch and is not C++ - it's QuakeC and meant to be used
within FTE QuakeWorld. The file extensions are only changed in order to help
with the syntax highlighting choice of your favorite editor.

This codebase is to be compiled with FTEQCC, no other compiler is supported.

A few warnings to the uneducated:
If you're planning on merging or using any of this code in combination with the
original Half-Life SDK, you're violating the Half-Life SDK License Agreement.

Thanks to Spike for FTEQCC's advanced features and his engine, FTEQW, that makes
FreeCS and other projects even possible.
