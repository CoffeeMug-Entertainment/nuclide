HALF-LIFE ENTITY BASE - QUAKEC VERSION
======================================

This server-side logic is part of the FreeCS project.
It's a reverse-engineering effort to get Half-Life entities closely
compatible with FTE QuakeWorld.

They are made possible through the documentation efforts of https://twhl.info

It's created from scratch and is not C++ - it's QuakeC and meant to be used
within FTE QuakeWorld. The file extensions are only changed in order to help
with the syntax highlighting choice of your favorite editor.

This codebase is to be compiled with FTEQCC, no other compiler is supported.

The code has a LICENSE attached to it, I'd encourage you to read it.
If you don't want to comply with the LICENSE, you either don't use the software
or we could still negotiate a separate license agreement (for $$$).

A few warnings to the uneducated:
If you're planning on merging or using any of this code in combination with the
original Half-Life SDK, you're violating the Half-Life SDK License Agreement.

I hope this all does not discourage you from using it for your own project.

Thanks to Spike for FTEQCC's advanced features and his engine, FTEQW, that makes
FreeCS and other projects even possible.
