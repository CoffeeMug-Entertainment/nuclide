### Syntax {#syntax}

**portal**

### Overview {#overview}

Specifies that this texture is the surface for a portal or mirror. In
the game map, a portal entity must be placed directly in front of the
texture (within 64 game units). All this does is set "sort portal", so
it isn't needed if you specify that explicitly.
