### Syntax {#syntax}

**vmap_surfaceLightDistance <scale>**

### Overview {#overview}

Increases the range of a surfacelight. This is different from increasing
the [vmap_surfaceLight (Material
Command)](vmap_surfaceLight) value, as
it'll travel much wider without affecting the total intensity of the
light.
