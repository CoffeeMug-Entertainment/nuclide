# Sound: EAX
Creative Technology's **Environmental Audio Extensions**, also known as **EAX**, attempted to create more ambiance within video games by more accurately simulating a real-world audio environment.


Due to the release of Windows Vista which deprecated the DirectSound3D API EAX was based on in 2007, Creative discouraged EAX implementation in favor of its [OpenAL](OpenAL.md)-based EFX equivalent.


EFX is fully supported in **FTEQW** and exposed via user-friendly entities and scripting language in **Nuclide**.
