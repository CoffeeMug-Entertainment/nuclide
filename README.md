# ![FTE Logo](Documentation/fte.svg) Nuclide - Software Development Kit 

Software Development Kit, built around idTech with focus on advanced features and
clean-room implementations of true-and-tested game-logic frameworks.
It's been used to ship a commercial product. So it's proven to some extent.

All of this is written in QuakeC, but there's also some GLSL and shell scripts
in here. If you and your team are unfamilar with any of these, you may want something else.

## Documentation
