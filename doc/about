About Nuclide

The Nuclide project produces a freely available game-logic component and 
development platform on top of FTEQW; which is the engine we use.
Our goals is to create a modern research base for new advancements, as well
as to have a stable base with a good API for games.

- Client-side predicted movement and inputs for things like weapons-systems
- Lots of well documented objects to use in level formats supported by FTEQW
- Reference implementations for a lot of features exlusive to FTEQW compared
  to other idTech engines
- Designed to be familar to developers who're used to GoldSrc and Source engine
  projects

1. Why might I want to use it?

You want to develop a game using a lot of complex and well-tested objects
which might be tedious to implement on your own.
You want to run or make modifications for a game using Nuclide and need full
control over what you can do.

2. How free is Nuclide?

Everything in Nuclide is free. The copyright terms for the game-logic are
very permitting. Nuclide does not use the GPL as a point of reference, it
instead uses a ISC-like license. This means you can use, copy, modify and
distribute the code and work resulting from it for any purpose.
Please read the very short 'license' document for details.

3. What are the alternatives?

Implementing systems such as prediction, complex map objects and entities on
your own or licensing another engine such as Source that ships with its own
Source SDK Base.
